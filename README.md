# 2048-solver
An 2048 solver using Tensorflow. The 2048 game is implemented, but the neural network is currently not working.

## How to run
To generate training data, run `python generate_training_data.py`. Then run `python train_nn.py` and you can check the accuracy by running `python test_nn.py`. If you want to compare it to a random player, try `python random_test.py`.
